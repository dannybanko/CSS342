1) Nothing will happen if you submit it a few minutes late as it is not considered late.
We obviously shouln't wait until last minute as the sumission closes an hour after the due time

2) No, you should not use tabs in your code because on the linux machine it will add a bunch of
extra spaces and you will exceed 80 columns

3) You will lose one point for every column above 80 until you've lost a letter grade.

4) The only time I used zoom befoe this class was for orientation. I was indifferent about it.
I like how it is still live which means that I am able to ask questions as we are being
instruxted. One thing I don't like about it is that it can be sort of glitchy at times.

5) I would assume it is because they aren't engaged in learning the material in class and they
say they will teach themselves at home. Also it probably has to do with starting assignments
late and not practicing the material outside of class time.
